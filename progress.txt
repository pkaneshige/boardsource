## Codebase Patterns
- Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based configuration with `@import "tailwindcss"` in globals.css, NOT tailwind.config.ts
- Use `@theme inline` directive in CSS for Tailwind theme customization
- PostCSS config uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for Tailwind v4
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled in tsconfig.json
- ESLint 9 flat config with Prettier: use `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` imports
- Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Run `npm run typecheck` to check TypeScript (uses `tsc --noEmit`)
- For fonts: use `next/font/google` and reference the variable in `@theme inline` in globals.css
- Sanity client: use `sanityFetch<T>(query, params)` from `lib/cms` for type-safe GROQ queries
- Use `@portabletext/react` with `PortableText` component to render Sanity block content
- Page types: define in `types/index.ts`, import `PortableTextBlock` from `@portabletext/types` for content arrays
- Sanity schemas: create in `lib/cms/schemas/`, use `defineType` and `defineField` from "sanity", export via `schemaTypes` array
- Sanity Studio: accessible at `/studio`, uses `next-sanity/studio` NextStudio component with catch-all `[[...tool]]` route
- Scraper module: use `lib/scraper` for all scraping-related code, import types/config from `@/lib/scraper`
- Hawaiian South Shore scraping: use Shopify JSON API at `/collections/{handle}/products.json` (not HTML scraping)
- Sanity write client: use `writeClient` from `lib/cms` with `SANITY_API_TOKEN` for mutations, requires `useCdn: false`
- Sanity image URLs: use `urlFor(image).width(N).height(N).url()` from `lib/cms` for responsive images
- Next.js Image: configure `remotePatterns` in next.config.ts for Sanity CDN (`cdn.sanity.io`)
- URL-based filters: use client component with useSearchParams/useRouter for interactive controls, server component builds GROQ query from searchParams
- Next.js 15 searchParams in pages are Promises: use `const params = await searchParams;`

## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- Created Sanity schema for surfboard products in `lib/cms/schemas/surfboard.ts`
- Registered surfboard schema in `lib/cms/schemas/index.ts` schemaTypes array
- Added Surfboard TypeScript type to `types/index.ts` with supporting types (SanityImage, SurfboardCategory, StockStatus)
- Files changed: lib/cms/schemas/surfboard.ts (new), lib/cms/schemas/index.ts, types/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sanity schema fields follow pattern: defineField with name, title, type, optional validation/description
  - For list options, use `options.list` array with {title, value} objects
  - For string enums with default, use `initialValue` property
  - Export schema from index.ts both in schemaTypes array AND as named export
  - TypeScript types for Sanity documents use optional properties (?) for non-required fields
  - SanityImage type structure: { _type: "image", asset: { _ref: string, _type: "reference" } }

  - Pagination uses `?page=N&limit=N` (max limit 250)
  - Product handles are URL-friendly slugs (e.g., "firewire-machadocado-52-62-futures-helium-2-surfboard")
  - Dimensions/volume often encoded in variant titles (e.g., "5'4 X 20 13/16 X 2 1/4 V28.8 - Grey")
  - Vendor field contains brand/shaper name
  - Tags array useful for category inference (shortboard, longboard, etc.)

- Added `source` and `sourceName` fields to `SurfboardDetailItem` interface
- Display "Available at {sourceName}" in product info section below shaper name (subtle gray text)
- Updated buy button to dynamically show "Buy at {sourceName}" or fallback to "Buy Now" when sourceName is missing
- Files changed: app/surfboards/[slug]/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use ternary operator for conditional button text: `sourceName ? \`Buy at ${sourceName}\` : "Buy Now"`
  - For source attribution text, use smaller/muted styling (text-sm text-gray-500) below primary info
  - Always include fallback text for optional fields in user-facing UI to handle legacy/missing data

- Added `relatedListings` field to Sanity surfboard schema in `lib/cms/schemas/surfboard.ts`
- Field is an array of references to other surfboard documents (for duplicate listings from other vendors)
- Created `SurfboardReference` interface in `types/index.ts` with `_type: "reference"` and `_ref: string`
- Added optional `relatedListings?: SurfboardReference[]` property to `Surfboard` interface
- Files changed: lib/cms/schemas/surfboard.ts, types/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sanity reference arrays use `type: "reference"` with `to: [{ type: "documentType" }]` syntax
  - Reference type structure: `{ _type: "reference", _ref: string }` where _ref is the document ID
  - For self-referencing schemas, use the same document type name in the `to` array
  - Keep reference types separate from the main document interface for reusability

## 2026-01-31 - US-025
- Created `lib/scraper/duplicate-detector.ts` with duplicate detection functionality
- Implemented `normalizeName` function: converts to lowercase, removes special chars, collapses whitespace
- Implemented `createComparisonKey` function: combines shaper + model name for matching (avoids duplication if shaper already in name)
- Implemented `calculateSimilarity` using Levenshtein distance normalized by max string length (returns 0-1 score)
- Implemented `findDuplicates` function: compares all products pairwise, returns matches above threshold
- Default threshold is 0.85, with `crossSourceOnly=true` to only match products from different vendors
- Returns `DuplicateMatch[]` with productId, matchedProductId, and similarity score
- Exported all functions and types from `lib/scraper/index.ts`
- Files changed: lib/scraper/duplicate-detector.ts (new), lib/scraper/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Levenshtein distance is O(n*m) where n and m are string lengths - may be slow for large catalogs
  - Normalize strings before comparison: lowercase, remove special chars, collapse whitespace
  - Combine shaper (brand) with product name for better matching, but avoid duplication if already included
  - Use `crossSourceOnly` flag to only match across different vendors (same board from different sources)
  - Pre-compute comparison keys for all products before pairwise comparison for efficiency

## 2026-01-31 - US-026
- Updated Surfgarage sync to run duplicate detection after upserting products (Phase 4)
- Created `linkRelatedListings` function in `lib/cms/write-client.ts` to update relatedListings bidirectionally
- Sync now fetches all in-stock surfboards from Sanity and runs `findDuplicates` with `crossSourceOnly: true`
- For each match, updates both products' relatedListings arrays to reference each other
- Includes duplicate check to avoid re-linking already linked products
- Logs detailed duplicate matches with similarity percentages for monitoring
- Exported `linkRelatedListings` from `lib/cms/index.ts`
- Files changed: lib/cms/write-client.ts, lib/cms/index.ts, lib/scraper/surfgarage/sync.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `_key` property when adding items to Sanity arrays (generated from document ID)
  - Check if products are already linked before updating to avoid duplicates in arrays
  - Fetch both products in parallel with Promise.all for efficiency before updating
  - Phase 4 runs even if previous phases had failures to ensure duplicates are still detected
  - Duplicate detection fetches only non-out_of_stock products to avoid linking unavailable items

## 2026-01-31 - US-027
- Added 'Also available at' section to product detail page for cross-vendor comparison
- Updated GROQ query with `relatedListings[]->{_id, name, price, sourceName, "slug": slug.current}`
- Added `RelatedListing` interface and updated `SurfboardDetailItem` with optional `relatedListings` array
- Section only renders when `relatedListings` array has items (conditional rendering)
- Each listing displays sourceName and price, links to `/surfboards/{slug}` for that product
- Styled as secondary card below buy button with subtle background, borders, and hover effects
- Files changed: app/surfboards/[slug]/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use GROQ dereference operator `->` to fetch fields from referenced documents: `relatedListings[]->{fields}`
  - Use computed field syntax for nested paths: `"slug": slug.current` to flatten slug object
  - Conditional rendering with `array && array.length > 0` ensures section only shows when data exists
  - For secondary/alternative options UI, use subtle styling (bg-gray-50, smaller text) to distinguish from primary CTA

## 2026-01-31 - US-028
- Added Source filter dropdown to surfboards listing page FilterControls component
- Added `source` parameter to SearchParams interface and currentFilters
- Created SOURCE_OPTIONS constant with All Sources, Hawaiian South Shore, and Surf Garage
- Updated `buildGroqQuery` to include source filter condition when param present
- Updated `hasActiveFilters` check to include source filter
- Filter persists in URL as ?source=hawaiian-south-shore or ?source=surfgarage
- Works in combination with all existing filters (category, price, shaper, search, sort)
- Files changed: app/surfboards/page.tsx, app/surfboards/filter-controls.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow existing FilterControls pattern: add prop to interface, add to currentFilters object, add to hasActiveFilters check
  - Use consistent option format with { value, label } for dropdown options across filters
  - Source values match schema values exactly (e.g., 'hawaiian-south-shore', 'surfgarage')
  - GROQ source filter uses exact match: `source == "${params.source}"`
